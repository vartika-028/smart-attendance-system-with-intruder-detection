Attendance system that recognizes faces to mark attendance and alerts in case of an intruder.
The Smart Attendance System with Intruder Detection is a computer vision-based project that automates student attendance marking and detects intruders. Using facial recognition, the system identifies registered students and marks their attendance in an Excel sheet. If an unregistered person (intruder) is detected, the system captures a snapshot and generates an alert.
